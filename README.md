# Laga_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
This project will use a red-black binary search tree to simulate a Pokedex containing the 150 original Pokemon. The user can search for a Pokemon by name, and the program will return pokedex number, evolutions, category, weight, height and abilities. The user can also search by category, and the program will return a list of all Pokemon under this category. The user may also add or delete Pokemon to fully customize their pokedex. The user may search Pokemon by type, and all Pokemon of that type will be added to a vector, and then the user may select a list number to learn more about a Pokemon of that type. The user may also search Pokemon by ability, and this will function similarly to searching by type.
