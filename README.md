# Laga_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
This project will use a red-black binary search tree to simulate a Pokedex containing the 150 original pokemon. The user can search for a pokemon by name, and the program will return pokedex number, evolutions, category, weight, height and abilities. The user can also search by category, and the program will return a list of all pokemon under this category. The user may also add or delete pokemon to fully customize their pokedex. Under each pokemon, an array will contain information regarding the evolutions. For example, if the user searches for Charmander, the program will as if they would like to look at the evolutions, and if the user selects yes, the program will inform them about Charmeleon and Charizard.
