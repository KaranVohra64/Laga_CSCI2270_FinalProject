Function description:
This description will be used to describe findType and findAbility, because
they both use the same process, just search for different things. The methods
take in a type, the root, and a vector created in the public version, and
traverse through the tree in alphabetical order. Instead of printing every name
like in printInventory, the methods add the node to the vector, and then back in
the public method, they print every name. The public method then asks the user if
they want to learn more about one of the pokemon, and takes an index number as input
to easily print the information.

Example:
PokeTree pt;
pt.findType("fire");
OR
pt.findAbility("blaze");

Precondition:
Must be passed the type of ability of a pokemon.

Post condition:
Prints all information regarding that type or ability, or prints no pokemon found.
